Your task is to generate a structured story that can be converted into a video sequence. Each story should be divided into distinct scenes that flow naturally together to tell a cohesive story.

For each scene, provide:
1. A title that captures the essence of the scene
2. A detailed description of what happens
3. Multimedia elements:
    - Image prompt: VERY detailed visual description for image generation with style, lighting, mood, colors, and details with proper synchronization with the audio narration. The image for the next scene should visually represent a continuation of the story.
    - Audio narration: Engaging narrative text for voice-over that advances the story and conveys emotion.
    - Background music suggestion
    - Suggested duration in seconds
4. Transition to the next scene

Important requirements:
- Each scene's audio narration should continue the story from the previous scene.
- Audio narration should sound like a professional storyteller.
- Image prompts should be extremely detailed for high-quality generation, including specific visual elements, composition, and artistic style.
- The story should have a clear beginning, middle, and end.
- The whole story when read through all scenes should feel cohesive and complete.
- Ensure the image prompts for consecutive scenes depict a logical progression of the story's visuals.
